What is good about this elevator control panel is that the primary buttons are mostly aligned and the labeling is clear, fairly large, and fairly easy to correlate to the associated button. The panel location is also at a good height for most people, low enough for somebody in a wheelchair to easily reach but not so low that a tall user would have to bend over to operate it.

	What I dislike about the elevator control panel design is that the ground floor button is not in the same alignment as every other available button on the panel. Instead, its label is in line with a button and the button is in line with a label. Also, the right lights around the buttons are small and dim. Another issue I had with this control interface, not caught in the operation gif because of damage, is that the floor indicator is much too high to see unless you stand in the back of the elevator and look up. This is bad for when it is full or somebody at a lower height needs to read the indicator.

Actions taken in an elevator:
* Select floor
* Hold door opened
* Close door sooner
* Call for help

This interface does an average job at making those actions possible.

The common sequence of actions a user would take are:
+ Enter the carriage
+ Select a floor
+ Check if somebody was coming
    + a. Hold the door if space and person coming
    + b. Close the door if no space or nobody coming
    + c. Wait for doors to close
+ Wait for carriage to arrive at selected floor
    + a. Wait for other stops
+ Exit
